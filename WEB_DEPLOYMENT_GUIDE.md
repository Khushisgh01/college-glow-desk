## üöÄ Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

### Option 1: Drag & Drop Deployment (Easiest)

1. **Build your project locally** (if you have Node.js installed):
   - Open your project folder
   - Run `npm run build` in your terminal/command prompt
   - This creates a `dist` folder

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up/Login with GitHub, GitLab, or email
   - Drag and drop your `dist` folder onto the Netlify dashboard
   - Your site will be live instantly!

### Option 2: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Upload your project files
   - Make sure to include `netlify.toml` file

2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy

## üîß Backend Deployment (Render)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Backend

1. **Create a GitHub repository** for your backend:
   - Upload your `server` folder
   - Include `package.json` in the root
   - Make sure all dependencies are listed

### Step 2: Deploy on Render

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**:
   - Visit [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Sign up/Login with GitHub

2. **Create New Web Service**:
   - Click "New" ‚Üí "Web Service"

   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Go to "Environment" tab
   - Add these variables:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/college-glow-desk?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-cloudinary-api-key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-api-secret

     to = "/index.html"
     status = 200
   ```

2. **Update `vite.config.ts`**:
   ```typescript
   export default defineConfig({
     server: {
       proxy: {
         '/api': {
           target: 'https://your-render-app.onrender.com',
           changeOrigin: true,
         },
       },
     },
     // ... rest of config
   });

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

### Test Backend
1. Visit: `https://your-app.onrender.com`
2. Should show: "API is running..."
3. Test endpoints:
   - `https://your-app.onrender.com/health`
   - `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/academic/subjects?branch=Computer Science&year=1`

### Test Frontend
1. Visit your Netlify URL
2. Check if the app loads correctly
3. Test file upload functionality

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend 500 Error**:
   - Check environment variables on Render
   - Verify MongoDB connection string
   - Check Cloudinary credentials

2. **Frontend Not Loading**:
   - Check if `dist` folder was uploaded correctly
   - Verify `netlify.toml` configuration
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **API Calls Failing**:
   - Verify backend URL in frontend configuration
   - Check CORS settings
   - Ensure backend is running

### Getting Help

1. **Render Logs**:
